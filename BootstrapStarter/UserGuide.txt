  Cyber Security Club will have access to all webpage files as here posted within this GitHub repository.
  Requirements for setup is to have web files on a web server (i.e. Apache, IIS). Web files cannot be through localhost.


Logins:
  No logins are necessary. For a real user experience, users can see account data through back-end code.

Connections:
  Connection needs to be configured in database .dp file.
  Setup requires IP address to be changed to the database host IP (comments in code).

All documentation is in the back-end code and written to an audience of IT system administrators.
